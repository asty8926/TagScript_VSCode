# TagScript_VSCode
Very useful files to directly highlight TagScript code and get IntelliSense (autocompletion) directly into VSCode!

Thank you Chelsie#2507 for this amazing discovery.

### IntelliSense/Autocompletion
I bet you've always dreamt of starting to type a block, and for your IDE to do the rest like in other programming languages.
Wait no more, because I made it a thing using VSCode's User Snippets!

It even includes keywords to directly use useful tips and code snippets made by the community, such as one to add a per-user cooldown to your tag, generate a random color, using the famous "Switch" method everyone talks about, and more!

![Adding a cooldown to your tag has never been that easy!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/522912772086956042/812488931177136148/2021-02-20_02-00-36.gif)

I included every single TagScript block, as well as all the math blocks referenced in the Documentation, along with their description, so you can know what any block does directly into VSCode while coding. I believe all this opens a better and brand new era for TagScript.

I'm also releasing it all on GitHub so you guys can contribute if you wish to! I'm leaving the Pull Requests open for this repository, so anyone who's willing to suggest changes can.
