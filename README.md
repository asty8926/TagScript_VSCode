# TagScript_VSCode
Very useful files to directly **highlight TagScript code** and get **IntelliSense (autocompletion)** directly into VSCode!

### VSCode Extension
Add custom colors to any word or range of words/blocks in TagScript using the extension below!
You can directly import my color profile/configuration using the JSON file in the files above.

Special thanks to Elise#7543 for this amazing discovery.

### IntelliSense/Autocompletion
I bet you've always dreamt of starting to type a block, and for your IDE to do the rest like in other programming languages.
Wait no more, because I made it a thing using **VSCode's User Snippets**!

It even includes keywords to directly use **useful tips and code snippets made by the community**, such as one to add a per-user cooldown to your tag, generate a random color, using the famous "Switch" method everyone talks about, and more!

### How to use
**1.** Download and open VSCode

**2.** On the left menu, click on `Extensions`, search `Custom Coloring` by Altrue, click `Install`

**3.** Open my `colorProfile.json` file, copy its text content

**4.** In the extension settings, scroll down. Where it says "Preview a profile", paste the color profile content, click "Load Profile"

**5.** Now you should notice at the bottom left of VSCode a button to switch profiles and disable/enable highlighting

**6.** If you don't already have a folder on your computer where you store all your custom commands, create one. In that folder, create a subfolder called `.vscode` (with the period) and put the `TagScript.code-snippets` file inside of it

### Demo
Here's a little example on how to add a per-user cooldown to your tag in seconds:
![Adding a cooldown to your tag has never been that easy!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/522912772086956042/812488931177136148/2021-02-20_02-00-36.gif)

I included **every single TagScript block** as well as all the math blocks referenced in the Documentation, along with their description, so you can know what any block does directly into VSCode while coding. I believe all this opens a better and brand new era for TagScript.

I'm also releasing it all on GitHub so you guys can contribute if you wish to! I'm leaving the Pull Requests open for this repository, so anyone who's willing to suggest changes can.

Enjoy!
